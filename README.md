# npc-damage-health-editor

Allows you to edit the damage output and health of npcs in a way that should be compatible with most duplicators.

Simply edit the weight of an npc, then copy and paste it, and the npc will be buffed!

NPCs will have their health and damage buffed by their current weight / their default weight,
So, say that you triple a zombies' weight, from 100 to 300, the damage output and health of the npc will triple as well.

this addon will only work consistently with default npcs.
npcs sometimes won't gain their buffed HP if multiple npcs are spawned in a paste, so if you want to keep it safe, spawn only one buffed npc per paste.
the HP buff notification message can be hidden by spawning the npc out of sight, behind some world geometry. (for singleplayer maps)
may be incompatible with other addons that change npc health and damage output (INPC)


Special thanks to peri who got me into this whole mess, and sam for helping me learn glua.
